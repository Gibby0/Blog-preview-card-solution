### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Google Fonts - specifically the Figtree font family, enhancing the stylistic delivery of the component.


### What I learned

Through this project, I learned the importance of using em instead of px for font sizes to ensure consistency across different screen sizes without overlapping. Additionally, I gained experience in utilizing flex-direction to structure content effectively.

```html
none
```
```css
.body {
  flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: flex-start; 
}
```

### Continued development
In future projects, I aim to continue focusing on refining and perfecting techniques learned in this project, such as responsive design and further exploration of CSS properties.

### Useful resources

- [Google Fonts - Figtree]('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Figtree:ital,wght@0,300..900;1,300..900&display=swap') - This helped me aquire the font needed for the project.
